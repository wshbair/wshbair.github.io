summary: A platform for developing visually XRPL hooks smart contract using Blockly from Google. The paltform helps users to develop XRPL Hook using visual drag-and-drop blocks. Also it compiles the hook code into WASM format. We have integrated also the deployment function to the XRPL Hook testnet network.
