summary: The project is a key management solution based on the HSM technology to control the life cycle of Ethereum public and private keys. Alongside the cryptographic operations required for signing transactions.

The security of distributed applications backed by blockchain technology relies mainly on keeping the associated cryptographic keys (i.e. private keys) in well-protected storage. Since they are the unique proof of ownership of the underlying digital assets. If the keys are stolen or lost, there is no way
to recover the assets. The cold wallet is a good candidate for basic use cases, but it has a substantial challenge for more
complex applications as it does not scale. Warm and hot wallets are more convenient options for blockchain-based solutions that
aim to transact in a cloud environment. In this work, we focus on Hardware Security Module (HSM) based wallet. The HSM
is the de-facto standard device designed to manage high-value cryptographic keys and to protect them against hacks. In this
demonstration, we present an HSM-based working prototype that secures the entire life cycle of Ethereum public and private keys.
